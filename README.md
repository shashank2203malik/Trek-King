My first full-stack web application. Essentially, it is a review website for Treks in India. The core features included are login and sign-up for user authentication, Maptiler Maps API, and (CRUD) functionality, comments and reviews for various trails. The basic foundation was built from the 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' by Colt Steele.
