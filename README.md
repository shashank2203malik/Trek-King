# Trek-King

My first full-stack web application. Essentially, it is a review website for Treks in India. The core features included are login and sign-up for user authentication, Maptiler Maps API for implementing a cluster map to make it more user-friendly and intuitive , and (CRUD) functionality for creating a new trek and/or reviewing treks made by other authors. The basic foundation of this project was built from the web course 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' by Colt Steele.
